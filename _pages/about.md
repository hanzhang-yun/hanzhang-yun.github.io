I'm currently a 2nd-year PhD student in math at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Xiang Tang](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~xtang/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zuoqin Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/).

My research interests lie in operator theory, differential geometry, and their interaction.
