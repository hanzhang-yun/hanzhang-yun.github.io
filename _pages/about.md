## My Name

My family name is 员(*pinyin*: yùn). It is a rare Chinese family name. The character 员 is usually pronounced as same as 园(*pinyin*: yuán) in Mandarin Chinese, but when used as a family name it is pronounced yun(*Pinyin*: yùn). My given name is Hanzhang (含章), a phrase that appears in *I Ching*, meaning “to embody virtue and talent without outward display.” Although my father, who chose the name, denies this origin, I still like it very much.

## My Homotown

I come from the northwest of China. My hometown, Weinan(渭南), is a small city neighboring Xi’an(西安), with which it shares close geographical and cultural ties. Since Xi’an is relatively well-known as a city with a long and rich history, I sometimes say that I come from Xi’an. My hometown is also home to Mount Hua, famous for its breathtakingly steep peaks, and we take pride in our local foods, such as roujiamo, biangbiang noodles, and yangrou paomo.
