I'm currently a 2nd-year PhD student in math at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Xiang Tang](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~xtang/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zuoqin Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/).

## Research Interests

Roughly speaking, I'm interested in operator theory, differential geometry, and their interactions. During my master's study, under the supervision of Prof. Wang, I worked on spectral geometry and microlocal analysis. In this process, I was introduced some ideas and perspectives of noncommutative geometry, which sparked my interest and motivated me to pursue a PhD in this field. Currently, I am studying index theory and K-theory. If you share similar interests, I would be very happy to discuss them with you!

#### About My Name

My family name is 员(*pinyin*: yùn). It is a rare Chinese family name. The character 员 is usually pronounced as same as 园(*pinyin*: yuán) in Mandarin Chinese, but when used as a family name it is pronounced yun(*Pinyin*: yùn). My given name is Hanzhang (含章), a phrase that appears in *I Ching*, meaning “to embody virtue and talent without outward display.” Although my father, who chose the name, denies this origin, I still like it very much.

#### About My Homotown

I come from the northwest of China. My hometown, Weinan(渭南), is a small city neighboring Xi’an(西安), with which it shares close geographical and cultural ties. Since Xi’an is relatively well-known as a city with a long and rich history, I sometimes say that I come from Xi’an. My hometown is also home to Mount Hua, famous for its breathtakingly steep peaks, and we take pride in our local foods, such as roujiamo, biangbiang noodles, and yangrou paomo.
