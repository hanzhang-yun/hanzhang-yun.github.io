I'm currently a 2nd-year PhD student in math at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Xiang Tang](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~xtang/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zuoqin Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/).

## Research Interests

Roughly speaking, I'm interested in operator theory, differential geometry, and their interactions. During my master's study, under the supervision of Prof. Wang, I worked on spectral geometry and microlocal analysis. In this process, I was introduced some ideas and perspectives of noncommutative geometry, which sparked my interest and motivated me to pursue a PhD in this field. Currently, I am studying index theory and K-theory. If you share similar interests, I would be very happy to discuss them with you!
