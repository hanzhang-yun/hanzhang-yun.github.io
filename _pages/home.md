I'm currently a PhD student in math at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Xiang Tang](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~xtang/) and Prof. [Yanli Song](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~ylsong/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zuoqin Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/).

## Research Interests

Roughly speaking, I'm interested in operator theory, differential geometry, and their interactions. During my master's study, under the supervision of Prof. Wang, I worked on spectral geometry and microlocal analysis. In this process, I was introduced some ideas and perspectives of noncommutative geometry, which sparked my interest and motivated me to pursue a PhD in this field. Currently, I am studying index theory and K-theory. If you share similar interests, I would be very happy to discuss them with you!

## Seminar

**Present**

If you are interested in any of these seminar, please feel free to come on by!

- I'm co-organizing Szegő Seminar (we are meeting every other Friday in Eads 103 with free pizza provided)  
**Ads:** The Szegő Seminar is organized by and for graduate students. It’s a space to share math we find interesting ideas from our research, things we’ve been reading, or anything else cool in math. We still have two spots available for speakers this semester. Don't hesitate-reach out to me to sign up!
- I'm attending the NCG seminar (we are meeting every Thursday 3pm-4pm to read the book *Spin Geometry* by Lawson and Michelsohn)
- I'm organizing the BGV reading seminar (we are meeting every Wednesday 11am-12pm to read the book *Heat Kernels and Dirac Operators* by Berline, Getzler and Vergne)
