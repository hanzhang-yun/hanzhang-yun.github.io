## Seminar

**Present**

If you are interested in any of these seminar, please feel free to come on by!

- I'm co-organizing Szegő Seminar (we are meeting every other Friday in Eads 103 with free pizza provided)  
**Ads:** The Szegő Seminar is organized by and for graduate students. It’s a space to share math we find interesting ideas from our research, things we’ve been reading, or anything else cool in math. We still have two spots available for speakers this semester. Don't hesitate-reach out to me to sign up!

- I'm attending the NCG seminar (we are meeting every Thursday 3pm-4pm to read the book *Spin Geometry* by Lawson and Michelsohn)
- I'm organizing the BGV reading seminar (we are meeting every Wednesday 11am-12pm to read the book *Heat Kernels and Dirac Operators* by Berline, Getzler and Vergne)
